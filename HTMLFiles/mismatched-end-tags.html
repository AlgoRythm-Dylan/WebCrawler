Man, this HTML is wacky, isn't it!

Here's how it's supposed to parse:
(well, the fricked up part)

<div>
    <span>Hello world!</span>
    <p>This is a paragraph!</p>
</div>
<h1>This is a heading!</h1>

- The span closing tags are ignored because the opening tag
  already has a closing tag
- The div closing tag automatically closes the p tag
- The extra div tag is ignored
